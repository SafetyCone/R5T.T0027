R5T.T0027.Construction - A construction console-app for the library R5T.T0027.

Goals


Project Descriptions

R5T.T0027.Configuration.DefaultAppSettings - Intersection of configuration and the default appsettings file.
R5T.T0027.Configuration.SecretsFilePaths - Add secrets directory file paths.


Startup

R5T.T0027.T001 - Zero service-dependencies startup base.

R5T.T0027.T002 - Logged and logging startup base.

R5T.T0027.T003 - Add appsettings.json file in a service-less way.

R5T.T0027.T004 - Add basic service functionality.

* A001 Services:
	* Secrets directory file path.
	* A003 services:
		* Environment variables.
		* Path-related operators.
		* Executable directory path.
		* AppSettings file path.

R5T.T0027.T007 - Startup with:

* A004 services:
	* Machine-location aware secrets file paths.
	* A003 services:
		* Environment variables.
		* Path-related operators.
		* Executable directory path.
		* AppSettings file path.


R5T.T0027.T008 - T006 ConfigurationConfigurationStartup rebranded as just Startup.

=> Meant to be used as the first stage of a multi-stage startup process.

Requires an ILogger startup provider service dependency.

* Logged.
* Requires no services in configuring IConfiguration.
* Services available during configuration of the next stage:
	* AddDefaultAndEnvironmentNameSpecificAppSettingsFilePaths operation.
	* Default AppSettings file path services.
	* Environment-specific AppSettings file path services.



R5T.T0027.T008 - StartupBase usuable in local-only projects.

* Logged
* Requires no services in configuring IConfiguration.
* Configuration:
	* Default appsettings.json file added servicelessly.
* Required services:
	* Organization provider.
* Provided services:
	* Required services
	* A001 Services:
		* Secrets directory file path.
		* A003 services:
			* Environment variables.
			* Path-related operators.
			* Executable directory path.
			* AppSettings file path.

Note, this is a more refined version of R5T.T0027.T004.


R5T.T0027.T009 - T008-based Startup useful as a configuration-startup in local-only projects.



Configuration Startup



Configuration Configuration Startup

R5T.T0027.T005 - Simple zero service dependencies configuration configuration startup including only the default appsettings.json file.

* Logging startup service dependency.
* IConfiguration:
	* Default appsettings.json file via service-less means.
* IServiceProvider
	* IAppSettingsFilePathProvider and IEnvironmentNameSpecificAppSettingsFilePathProvider services.
