R5T.T0027.T001 - Zero service-dependencies startup base.

Contains a startup class that explicitly communicates that its constructor, and the constructors of any derived classes, should require no services.

This means the startup class has zero service dependencies.

This is as opposed to a startup class that might require an ILogger, or other service when created (from a service provider).
